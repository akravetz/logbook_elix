## Planning Phase - No Code Change
DO NOT modify any code yet. First, analyze the codebase and requirements to create a concrete implementation plan. Use available commands to explore the project structure, dependencies, and existing patterns.

## Implementation Standards

Use production-quality code with proper error handling, logging, and testing
Leverage standard libraries and frameworks - avoid custom implementations when established solutions exist (e.g., use JWT libraries, not hand-rolled crypto)
Follow existing project conventions for code style, architecture patterns, and file organization
Use latest stable versions of dependencies and follow their recommended practices

## Deliverable Format
Provide a numbered task list with:

Concrete actions (e.g., "Create UserService class with authenticate() method")
Specific files to modify or create
Dependencies to add or update
Key implementation details (algorithms, data structures, API endpoints)

Ask clarifying questions about requirements, constraints, or architectural decisions before finalizing the plan.
