The parse_jwt_segment/2 function is not strict enough about the structure of a JWT. It checks if there are at least enough segments, but a valid JWT must have exactly three segments (header, payload, signature). This implementation could successfully parse malformed tokens with fewer than three parts, which might hide issues.

It would be more robust to explicitly pattern match for three segments.

The test suite for GoogleTokenVerifier is incomplete. It currently only tests for invalid token formats and helper functions in isolation. The main verify_token/1 function's success path and various failure scenarios are not covered.

For a critical security component like this, you should add tests for:

A full, successful token verification flow (this may require mocking the HTTP call to Google's certs endpoint).
Verification failure due to an invalid signature.
Verification failure due to an expired token (exp claim).
Verification failure due to an invalid issuer (iss claim).
Verification failure due to a token being used too early (iat claim).

Add `mix credo` static analysis to the GitHub Actions test workflow for improved code quality checking.
